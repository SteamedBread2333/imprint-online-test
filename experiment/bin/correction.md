# Memory writes

> **Setup:** [README.md](../README.md#quick-start). **Reference:** write loop, classification table, and worked examples.

Durable preferences from conversation land in `.imprint/vault.db` and **recall on the next task** steers behaviour. The agent **`find`s → classifies → writes**; users speak normally and never maintain rule ids.

## Who maintains the vault

**Users** keep working and talking normally — preferences, confirmations, and rejections in plain language. No `imprint` commands or rule ids required.

**Agents** run `find`, classify, and call `add` / `reinforce` / `supersede` / `forget`. When the user says “don’t record that” or “we follow STYLE.md now”, query the vault and act — never ask for a command or id.

**Humans (optional)** audit via `imprint desk open` or `show` when curious. Read-only review.

**Review + prune:** the user may ask to review naming memories and cut obsolete branches. The agent uses `show` / `get`, explains in plain language, then `supersede` / `forget` / `sweep` after they agree. Tidying the vault is fine; supplying ids or CLI is not.

CLI / MCP snippets in this doc are the **agent execution surface**.

| Step | Who | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Recall** | Agent | `find --scope tag,tag` + `--query` → rules, `documents`, `links` (shelves on) |
| **Classify** | Agent | ADD / REINFORCE / SUPERSEDE / IGNORE |
| **Write** | imprint | `add` (optional `sources`) / `reinforce` / `supersede` / `forget` |
| **Audit** | Human | `get`, `show`, desk; superseded/dormant rules in `vault.db` |

Prefer **MCP tools**; fall back to **`imprint --json`** ([mcp.md](mcp.md)).

## Four write classifications

| Class | When | Command | Vault effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ADD** | `find` empty; **new** preference (optional `sources` when document hit) | `add` | New `active` imprint, default confidence **0.6** |
| **REINFORCE** | Rule exists; user **confirms again** with non-empty evidence | `reinforce` | diminishing gain `min(0.95, old + (0.95-old)*0.25)`, `reinforcement_count++`, may wake `dormant` |
| **SUPERSEDE** | Preference **changed**, scope **widened/narrowed**, old claim **invalid** | `supersede` | Old → `superseded`; new `active` with `supersedes: [old_id]`; confidence uses trust-gap decay |
| **IGNORE** | One-off task, chit-chat, agent-**inferred** preference | (no write) | — |

Also:

| Op | When |
| --- | --- |
| **forget** | User negates in **plain speech** (“don’t record that”); agent `find`s then `forget`s — user never mentions imprint |
| **sweep** | Periodic decay of rules not confirmed recently (`last_confirmed_at`; default 90d −0.05; below 0.3 → `dormant`) |

Language scope tags (`ts`, `tsx`, `golang`) canonicalize to GitHub Linguist names via go-enry on add/find/list/supersede. Non-language tags (`naming`, `frontend`) pass through.

### Confidence (agent convention)

On `add`, set `--confidence` / MCP `confidence`:

| User tone | Suggested confidence |
| --- | --- |
| First mention, casual | **0.6** (default) |
| Explicit correction ("no, use …") | **0.85** |
| "From now on always …" | **0.85** on add; tier 0.9 only through later `reinforce` |

`reinforce` stacks on the current value. Policy changed → **supersede**; `0.85` applies to `add` corrections only.

#### Supersede confidence (trust-gap)

Successor confidence is not copied verbatim and is not reset to 0.85. It decays the gap above the 0.6 add baseline:

`new = old − (old − 0.6) × inheritance_alpha`

`inheritance_alpha` is `supersede.inheritance_alpha` in `imprint.yaml` (default **0.20**; **0** = copy old; **1** = drop to 0.6). If old confidence is already at or below 0.6, the successor is 0.6. Example: 0.6875 with alpha 0.20 → 0.67. `sources` / `query_local` still inherit unless overridden.

### Record only what the user said

- **`--text` / `text`**: user's words (evidence)
- **`claim`**: imperative statement for the agent
- No secrets; no inferred preferences. Server-side privacy and duplicate gates reject unsafe or redundant writes.

---

## Worked examples

Vault **`./.imprint`**. MCP and CLI are equivalent; one of each shown.

### 1. New preference — ADD

**User:** Go exported identifiers must be PascalCase, not snake_case exports.

**Agent**

1. `find --scope go,naming --query PascalCase` → no hits  
2. **ADD**

```bash
imprint --json --vault ./.imprint add \
  "Go exported identifiers must use PascalCase" \
  --scope go,naming \
  --text "Go exported identifiers must be PascalCase, not snake_case exports"
```

MCP `add`: same `claim`, `scope`, `text`; omit `confidence` (0.6).

---

### 2. User confirms again — REINFORCE

**User:** Yes, exports stay PascalCase — what I said before still holds.

**Agent**

1. `find --scope go,naming` → `r-2026-09-14-001`  
2. **REINFORCE**

```bash
imprint --json --vault ./.imprint reinforce r-2026-09-14-001 \
  --evidence "user confirmed PascalCase for exports again"
```

---

### 3. User narrows a wrong rule — SUPERSEDE

**User:** Not quite — internal packages can use unexported camelCase; only **cross-package exports** need PascalCase.

**Agent**

1. `find --scope go,naming` → old rule too broad  
2. **SUPERSEDE**

```bash
imprint --json --vault ./.imprint supersede r-2026-09-14-001 \
  --claim "Go identifiers exported across packages must use PascalCase; internal unexported names use camelCase" \
  --scope go,naming \
  --reason "narrowed to cross-package exports only" \
  --text "internal packages can use unexported camelCase; only cross-package exports need PascalCase"
```

Old id → `superseded` status; new id is `active`, confidence decays toward 0.6 by `inheritance_alpha`, and links back. `sources` / `query_local` inherit unless overridden.

---

### 4. Widen scope — SUPERSEDE

**User:** Same for frontend TS — exported components/functions follow PascalCase, aligned with Go.

```bash
imprint --json --vault ./.imprint supersede r-2026-09-14-002 \
  --claim "Exported Go and TypeScript symbols follow PascalCase (TS aligned with Go exports)" \
  --scope go,typescript,naming \
  --reason "extended naming rule to frontend TS" \
  --text "Same for frontend TS — exported components/functions follow PascalCase, aligned with Go"
```

---

### 5. Agent almost infers — IGNORE

**User:** Refactor this handler and split it into two files.

Task instruction, not a long-term preference → **IGNORE**. No `add`.

---

### 6. Preference voided — user talks, agent cleans up

**User:** Use `STYLE.md` for naming from now on — the PascalCase export rule we used before is gone.

**Agent**

1. `find --scope go,naming` → old rule `r-2026-09-14-003`  
2. **SUPERSEDE** (policy moved to `STYLE.md`, keep audit trail) or **forget** (user rejects imprint-stored naming prefs entirely)  
3. User never says “imprint”; commands below are agent-only

**Prefer supersede:**

```bash
imprint --json --vault ./.imprint supersede r-2026-09-14-003 \
  --claim "Follow STYLE.md for naming; imprint does not override the style guide" \
  --scope go,naming,docs \
  --reason "naming policy moved to STYLE.md" \
  --text "Use STYLE.md for naming from now on — the PascalCase export rule we used before is gone"
```

**If the user rejects imprint-held naming prefs** (“stop recording these”) → `forget r-2026-09-14-003`.

Reply in normal language — do not ask the user to confirm a rule id or pick a command.

---

### 7. Recall before coding — find

**User:** Add an exported method on `UserService`.

**Agent (before editing)**

```bash
imprint --json --vault ./.imprint find --scope go,naming --query export
```

Hit `[r-2026-09-14-002]` → name the method `GetProfile`, not `get_profile`; cite `[r-…]` when it shapes the change.

---

## Passive fade vs explicit writes

| Mechanism | Trigger | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **supersede / forget** | User speaks in plain language | Rule **wrong** or **void** (agent acts; user does not maintain the vault) |
| **reinforce** | User repeats | Rule still **valid**, strengthen |
| **sweep** | Ops / cron | Stale preferences **fade** (default 90d untouched −0.05; &lt; 0.3 → dormant) |

`sweep` does not erase history. A query may surface at most one dormant rule as a penalized `wake_candidate`; the hit itself changes nothing. Only an explicit user reconfirmation followed by `reinforce` wakes it.

---

## Quick reference

```bash
imprint --json --vault ./.imprint find --scope go,error-handling --query wrap
imprint --json --vault ./.imprint get r-2026-09-14-002
imprint --json --vault ./.imprint list --status active --scope go --min-confidence 0.85
imprint --json --vault ./.imprint show
imprint desk open
```
